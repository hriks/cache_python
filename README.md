# cache_python
Implemented a cache that on start-up would load data from a file into the cache. The cache would have an initial size of 20 elements and upon reaching its limit, to add any new element it would remove the least recently accessed element. On shutdown it should store the cached data back to the file. The data should be stored in the cache according to a caching strategy. Provide options for cache CRUD.
